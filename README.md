# Landlords
This is a webapp that will allow users to play the Chinese card game Dou dizhu, or "Fighting the Landlord."

But really, I just wanted to learn something and needed a project. Here are the topics I'm trying to learn with this project:
- ```asyncio```
- ```fastAPI```: I've used ```flask``` before but this is better for general API development. Not sure this is the best application for the library but it'll do.
- CI/CD: I want to setup integrating testing and deployment through github / maybe Jenkins.
- ```kubernetes```: I want to deploy this to the cloud with kubernetes and be able to scale depending on use.
- ```react```: I've never used it, why not try it for my shitty front end on this thing.
